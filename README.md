## Install

`yarn`

## Run
`node index.js [name]`

The input file will be `[name].html` (it is very important that the filename ends in html because it determines the mimetype with which puppeteer reads and parses the file) and the output file will be `[name].out.xhtml`

An example `bad.html` and `bad.out.xhtml` have been included as a demonstration.
